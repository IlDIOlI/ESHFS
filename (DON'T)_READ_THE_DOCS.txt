Okay, so I should make some config in for example

/etc/DIOFS/fs.conf

with something it like:

**[Encryption key path]
/key/user/secret.key

[All distributed dirs]
/opt
/home
/boot

[mode]
mode=slave

[master node]
master=192.168.0.1
backup=172.16.0.2

[port]
port=29092
**
like, for example as you see here (or up there)

Aaaaand of course I would need to make config in grub, make initramfs and some more….

For protocol I would suggest SFTP or…custom? IDK.
Settled on protocol gRPC, whatever.

OK, so we have our repo now.

SO we need to do other things. For example to do some metadata naming and setting its purpose..?

Metadata:

FILE Related
Size, Owner, Date of creation, Name, Directory, Access for this system (R,W,X), Modification time



ACCESS Related
Permitted Users, Last Accessed by user, ?Access history? IDK


FRAGS Related
Fragmentation in the file(count of the frags), Max size of the fragment, Nodes that have that fragment in storage, checksum, ?Encryption key? 

REPLICATION Related
Replicas of the fragment, Location of the replicas, version of the file for updates.

About fault handling,

Suggested opinion is that it should include replication, detecting and checking healthy nodes, alerting, how many replicas there should be and so on, and of course automatic failover or just a big red alert.

For more detailed access control, I think it just has to be in the main .config file, just as some parameter to whom it should be replicated and what does need to be replicated.



ENCRYPTION!!!!

For encryption would be used AES 256 and OpenSSL lib. It would require another config with a key to encrypted FS. I would also like to include the decryption interaction as a password. In future versions I will maybe implement something like a security key, idk.
