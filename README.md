# This is EnDFS, Encrypted Distributed File System.
This is mainly a project for fun with no intention to use? Who knows honestly.
This File System is supported only on **GNU/LINUX**, so sorry Windows, Haiku, Mac?, BSD or other folks, but maybe if you try hard enough it will even work on your machine.
After some time I will add some instructions and stuff.
https://t.me/unsecureprotocol < there will be updates, fun stuff and everything;
That's all for now, folks.
